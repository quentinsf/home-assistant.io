The `tellstick` component integrates [TellStick](https://telldus.com/produkt/z-wave-gateway-tellstick-znet-lite-ver-2/) devices into Home Assistant. This integration allows users to add switches, lights, and sensors which are communicating with 433 MHz. There are a number of vendors (Capidi Elro, Intertechno, Nexa, Proove, Sartano, and Viking) who are selling products that work with TellStick. For more details, please check the TellStick [protocol list](http://developer.telldus.com/wiki/TellStick_conf).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Cover](#cover)
- [Light](#light)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To get started, add the devices to your `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
tellstick:
```

For Hass.io users there is a [TellStick add-on](/addons/tellstick/) available.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for Hass.io with the TellStick add-on
tellstick:
  host: core-tellstick
  port: [50800, 50801]
```

{% configuration %}
signal_repetitions:
  description: Because the TellStick sends its actions via radio and from most receivers it's impossible to know if the signal was received or not. Therefore you can configure the switch and light to try to send each signal repeatedly.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 1
host:
  description: If you run TellStick on another server or with the Hass.io add-on.
  required: inclusive
  type: string
port:
  description: Needed with the `host` configuration variable. Must be port pair, for example `[50800, 50801]`.
  required: inclusive
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

## {% linkable_title Cover %}

This `tellstick` cover platform allows you to control your [TellStick](http://www.telldus.se/products/tellstick) covers.

To use your TellStick device, you first have to set up your [Tellstick hub](#configuration) and then add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: tellstick
```

## {% linkable_title Light %}

This `tellstick` light platform allows you to control your [TellStick](http://www.telldus.se/products/tellstick) dimmers.

To use your TellStick device, you first have to set up your [Tellstick hub](#configuration) and then add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  platform: tellstick
```

## {% linkable_title Sensor %}

The `tellstick` sensor platform allows you to get current meteorological data from a [TellStick](http://www.telldus.se/products/tellstick) device.

To use your TellStick device, you first have to set up your [Tellstick hub](#configuration) and then add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: tellstick
```

{% configuration %}
sensor:
  description: "Entry for a sensor with the ID and its name, e.g., ID: Name."
  required: false
  type: string
only_named:
  description: Only add and include specified sensors. If this is not specified all sensors will be imported and the names will be based on each sensor's ID number.
  required: false
  default: false
  type: list
  keys:
    id:
      description: The ID-number of the sensor to include.
      required: true
      type: integer
    name:
      description: Specify the name of the selected sensor.
      required: true
      type: string
temperature_scale:
  description: The scale of the temperature value.
  required: false
  default: °C
  type: string
datatype_mask:
  description: Mask to determine which sensor values to show based on. Please check the [TellCore tellcore.constants documentation](https://tellcore-py.readthedocs.org/en/v1.1.2/constants.html#module-tellcore.constants) for details.
