The `rejseplanen` sensor will provide you with travel details for Danish public transport, using timetable data from [Rejseplanen](https://www.rejseplanen.dk/).

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

Add a sensor to your `configuration.yaml` file as shown in the example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: rejseplanen
    stop_id: 'YOUR_STOP_ID'
```

The `stop_id` can be obtained by looking up the name of the stop at this link:

<http://xmlopen.rejseplanen.dk/bin/rest.exe/location?format=json&input=STOP_NAME>
(Replace "STOP_NAME" with city or location you want id for)
find the stop and copy the `id` field with the trailing zeros.

The sensor can filter the timetables by one or more routes, directions and types. The known types are listed in the table below.

| Departure type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| BUS | Normal bus |
| EXB | Express bus |
| M | Metro |
| S | S-train |
| REG | Regional train |

{% configuration %}
stop_id:
  description: The id of the public transport stop.
  required: true
  type: string
route:
  description: List of route names.
  required: false
  type: string|list
direction:
  description: List of directions to filter by.
  required: false
  type: string|list
departure_type:
  description: List of departure types to filter by.
  required: false
  type: string|list
{% endconfiguration %}

## {% linkable_title Direction %}

If you use the direction filter it's important to put correct destination, or else the sensor will not work at all.
The direction has to be the destination(s) for the transport type(s) for the departure stop destination, and NOT the stop where you want to get off. Check <http://rejseplanen.dk> and make a search, and use the destinations from there in your configuration. Make sure you use the exact name as the destination(s)

A working example on how to use this sensor with direction:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry with the correct use of direction.
sensor:
  - platform: rejseplanen
    stop_id: '008600615'
    direction:
      - 'CPH Lufthavn'
      - 'Helsingør St.'
```

A NOT WORKING example use this sensor with direction:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry with the correct use of direction.
sensor:
  - platform: rejseplanen
    stop_id: '008600615'
    direction:
      - 'København H'
```
It fails because the destination from the departure is NOT København H, but 'CPH Lufthavn', 'Helsingør St.' and others.

## {% linkable_title Examples %}

A more extensive example on how to use this sensor:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: rejseplanen
    stop_id: '000045740'
    route: 'Bus 350S'
    direction:
      - 'Herlev St.'
      - 'Ballerup St.'
```
