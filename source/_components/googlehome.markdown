The `googlehome` component allows you to connect to your Google Home device using an [unofficial Google Home API][googlehomeapi].

This component will provide:
- [device_tracker](/components/device_tracker/) platform to track nearby bluetooth devices;
- [sensor](/components/sensor/) platform to track the alarms and the timers.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To integrate the `googlehome` component in Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
googlehome:
  devices:
    - host: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
