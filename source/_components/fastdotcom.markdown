The `fastdotcom` component uses the [Fast.com](https://fast.com/) web service to measure network bandwidth performance.

<p class='note'>
Currently fast.com only supports measuring download bandwidth. If you want to measure bandwidth metrics other then download such as ping and upload, utilize the [speedtest](/components/sensor.speedtest) component.
</p>

Enabling this component will automatically create the Fast.com Sensor.

By default, a speed test will be run every hour. The user can change the update frequency in the configuration by defining the `scan_interval` for a speed test to run.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To add Fast.com to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

Once per hour, on the hour (default):

```yaml
fastdotcom:
```

Every half hour of every day:

```yaml
fastdotcom:
  scan_interval:
      minutes: 30
```

{% configuration %}
scan_interval:
  description: "Minimum time interval between updates. Supported formats: `scan_interval: 'HH:MM:SS'`, `scan_interval: 'HH:MM'` and Time period dictionary (see example below)."
  required: false
  default: 60 minutes
  type: time
manual:
  description: Turn manual mode on or off. Manual mode will disable scheduled speedtests.
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
{% endconfiguration %}

#### {% linkable_title Time period dictionary example %}

```yaml
scan_interval:
  # At least one of these must be specified:
  days: 0
  hours: 0
  minutes: 3
  seconds: 30
  milliseconds: 0
```

### {% linkable_title Service %}

Once loaded, the `fastdotcom` component will expose a service (`fastdotcom.speedtest`) that can be called to run a Fast.com speed test on demand. This service takes no parameters. This can be useful if you have enabled manual mode.

```yaml
action:
  service: fastdotcom.speedtest
```

## {% linkable_title Notes %}

- When running on Raspberry Pi, the maximum speed is limited by its 100 Mbit/s LAN adapter.
- The sensor will return the maximum measured speed during a 15-second test.
