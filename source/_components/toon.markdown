The `toon` component platform can be used to control your Toon thermostat. This component adds a climate device for your Toon thermostat, sensors for power and gas consumption, sensors for solar production and several binary sensors for things like boiler burner on/off, hot tap water and boiler health status.

For the `toon` component to work, you'll need an active Toon subscription with Eneco and a Toon API developer account.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- [Climate](#climate)
- Sensor

## {% linkable_title Setting up a developer account %}

In order to be able to use this component, you'll need to sign up for a free Toon API developer account.

1. Visit the [Toon API developers website](https://developer.toon.eu/), and [sign in](https://developer.toon.eu/user/login). [Create an account](https://developer.toon.eu/user/register) if you donâ€™t have one already.
2. Open the "[My Apps](https://developer.toon.eu/user/me/apps)" page and click on "Add a new App" button on the top right.
3. The "Add App" page shows a form with two fields:
   - **App Name**: Can be anything you like, for example, "Home Assistant" will just do.
   - **Callback URL**: Fill in `localhost` in this field.
4. Click on "Create App" to complete the creation process.
5. Open the "[My Apps](https://developer.toon.eu/user/me/apps)" page again and click on the app that you've just created.
6. You need the codes now shown: "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret".
7. Add the Toon component to your `configuration.yaml` and restart Home Assistant. Then, go to `Configuration > Integrations` and select `CONFIGURE` next to Toon and follow the setup instructions.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To use your Toon in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
toon:
  client_id: YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
  client_secret: YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
```

{% configuration %}
client_id:
  description: Toon API Consumer Key.
  required: true
  type: string
client_secret:
  description: Toon API Consumer Secret.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## {% linkable_title Climate %}

The `toon` climate platform allows you to interact with your Toon thermostat. For compatibility reasons, the states in Home Assistant are different from the states displayed on your Toon device and are mapped as follows:

| Home Assistant | Toon    |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Auto           | Comfort |
| Heat           | Thuis   |
| Eco            | Weg     |
| Cool           | Slapen  |

It also supports setting the temperature manually.

The Toon API is polled at a 30-second interval, so the status is relatively fresh without overloading the API.
