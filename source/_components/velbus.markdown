The `velbus` component supports the Velbus USB, Velbus serial and a TCP/IP gateway.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- Climate
- Sensor
- Switch

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

The gateway needs to be configured by adding the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for a USB or serial interface
velbus:
  port: '/dev/ttyUSB00'
```

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for a TCP/IP interface
velbus:
  port: '127.0.0.1:3678'
```

{% configuration %}
