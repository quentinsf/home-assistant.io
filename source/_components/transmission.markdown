The `transmission` component allows you to monitor your downloads with [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) from within Home Assistant and setup automation based on the information.

## {% linkable_title Setup %}

To use the monitoring, your transmission client needs to allow remote access. If you are running the graphical transmission client (transmission-gtk) go to **Edit** -> **Preferences** and choose the tab **Remote**. Check **Allow remote access**, enter your username and your password, and uncheck the network restriction as needed.

If everything is set up correctly, the details will show up in the frontend.

## {% linkable_title Event Automation %}

The Transmission component is continuously monitoring the status of torrents in the target client. Once a torrent is started or completed, an event is triggered on the Home Assistant Bus, which allows to implement any kind of automation.

Possible events are:

- transmission_downloaded_torrent
- transmission_started_torrent

Inside of the event, there is the name of the torrent that is started or completed, as it is seen in the Transmission User Interface.

Example of configuration of an automation with completed torrents:

```yaml
- alias: Completed Torrent
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: transmission_downloaded_torrent
  action:
    service: notify.telegram_notifier
    data_template:
      title: "Torrent completed!"
      message: "{{trigger.event.data.name}}"
```
